# AI Space

**Open Wisdom Lab (OWL)** is a modular knowledge base for building and operating AI Spaces / Maker Spaces. It provides a complete guide from philosophy to practice.

## Quick Start

Explore OWL in three layers:

1. **Philosophy Layer** - Core beliefs and cutting-edge research
2. **Action Layer** - Methodology and operational manuals
3. **Documentation** - Architecture, collaboration, and updates

## Key Features

### Modular Architecture

9 core modules covering the full lifecycle of maker spaces, each with three layers:
- **Core** - Quick start essentials
- **Extended** - Deep learning materials
- **Evidence** - Academic support

### AI-Powered Tools

Interactive design tools powered by AI:
- Floor plan generator
- Space layout optimizer
- Equipment selection wizard

### Multi-Language Support

Built-in internationalization with `next-intl` integration. Seamlessly switch between Chinese and English.
